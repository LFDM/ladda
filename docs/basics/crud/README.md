# CRUD

Ladda shows its whole potential in a create, read, update & delete application. The four pillars are the basic functions for a persistent storage. These are used in most RESTful APIs yet Ladda can opt-in to benefit from the paradigm.

* [Read](Read.md)
* [Create](Create.md)
* [Update](Update.md)
* [Delete](Delete.md)
