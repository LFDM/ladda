# Demo
Check out some of our demos, designed to make benefits of Ladda clear. 

## Read Example
This is an example to see Ladda in action solely for the `READ` operation. It interacts with an API and shows how you would benefit from the cache. In addition, it shows the time to live ([TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live)), because every cache expires eventually. You can [configure the TTL](/docs/basics/Configure.md) in Ladda.

## Examples in the Ladda Repository
There are a couple of [examples](https://github.com/petercrona/ladda/tree/master/examples) in the Ladda repository. You can clone Ladda to your local machine, navigate to one of the examples and follow the *README.md* to start the example.
