# Demo
Check out some of our demos, designed to make benefits of Ladda clear. 

## Hackernews
This is an example to see Ladda in action solely for the `READ` operation. It interacts with an API and shows how you would benefit from the cache. In addition, it shows the time to live (TTL) for every EntitiyValue which has been configured to 15 seconds. [Check it out](https://rwieruch.github.io/ladda-react-example/).

## Examples in the Ladda Repository
There are a couple of [examples](https://github.com/petercrona/ladda/tree/master/examples) in the Ladda repository. You can clone Ladda to your local machine, navigate to one of the examples and follow the *README.md* to start the example.
