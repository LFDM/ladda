# Demo

There is one playground to see Ladda in action solely for the `READ` operation. It interacts with an API and shows how you would benefit from the cache. Keep in mind that [Ladda is doing more](/docs/basics/Operations.md) than only `READ` operations. In addition, it shows the time to live ([TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live)), because every cache expires eventually. You can [configure the TTL](/docs/basics/Configure.md) in Ladda. **TODO LINK**

There are lightweight source examples in the Ladda repository. You can clone Ladda to your local machine, navigate to one of the examples and follow the *README.md* to start the example.

**TODO examples link**
**TODO 2 examples (minimum JS vanilla and React) with README.md about setup**
